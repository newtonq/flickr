This is the readme file for getting public users upload to your flickr account.

1) Setup your flickr account and create a new app.

2) Generate the API Key and Secret.

3) Download phpFlickr library from http://code.google.com/p/phpflickr/.

4) Modify your app settings by making the callbackURL point to 
   "getToken.php" in phpFlickr folder.

5) Fill in the missing details of getToken.php, make sure you include
   appropriate files (Add dir's to open_basedir setting in php.ini if
   required).   

6) From the browser, hit getToken.php, this will display the "token"   
  generated from the "frob". Paste this token in "uploadPhoto" function of index.php & 
  all further Flickr API calls will be valid and any upload done will
  be done to your account by general public.

7) For further help check the README.txt file in phpFlickr library.
